######## this pca was produced in r and this example includes mapping reads from 2 species to the reference genome of one out of 2 species.
######### this means i have hydnophytum mosleyanum and myrmecodia beccarii.
######### so in this exxample the reads from both species were produced using salmon by aligning the reads from both species to H.m.
######### salmon needs to be done first then everything else can be done in r
